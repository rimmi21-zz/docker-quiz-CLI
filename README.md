# Docker Quiz CLI Game 🐳

Hey there Player! 👻

Are you ready to play a CLI game?

Well it's pretty easy and basic!

## About

This game starts by asking your name. Followed by that, you'll be asked 5 questions with a list of choices. All you need to do, is select the right choices.

❌ Answering the wrong question will get the process killed ! 🤯

But that's alright, you can begin the game again.

## Installation

You can find the [game](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docker-game-cli) on npm.

To install the game, go to your terminal, and type the below command:

Cool! You're all set now! Play the game and win it!
